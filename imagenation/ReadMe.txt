Imagenation is a theme for Zenphoto – the simpler web gallery. The theme along with the system are suitable for your photoblog or gallery. If you haven't yet started with Zenphoto, the time is now! Go to http://zenphoto.org/ and explore, then download and install it.

---------- Installation ----------

Easy, in five steps. Don't miss steps 4 and 5 if you want the theme working properly!
1. Extract the downloaded archive.
2. Upload the "imagenation" folder to your "/themes/" directory.
3. Activate the theme through the "themes" menu in Zenphoto's admin panel.
4. Activate these plugins through the "plugins" menu in Zenphoto's admin panel:
– deprecated-functions;
– html_meta_tags;
– image_album_statistics;
5. Set the following values in the theme's options (go to "options", and then to "theme"):
– Thumb size: 150;
– Crop thumbnails: 150 x 100;
– Image size: 900, or smaller;

________________________________
---------- Tunning it ----------

Optional settings for better performance. I really recommend these, however they are not mandatory. If you're a zenphoto master then you know better for yourself.
1. Set the following values in the image's options (go to "options", and then to "image"):
– Image quality: 95, 90, 95;
– Sharpen: 55, 0.5, 1; also check both "Images" and "Thumbs";
2. Set the following values in the comment's options (go to "options", and then to "comment"):
– Check "CAPTCHA";
3. Change the introducing text placed in bottom of the pages:

    "Behind the Lens: YourName.
    Welcome, and hope you enjoy my gallery! You can find more info about me, or just get in touch at the about page."

4. License your content! But don't restrict too much. Change the license info placed in bottom of the pages:

    "License: Except where otherwise noted, content on this site is licensed under a Creative Commons License. Please read it before using any of my photos."

5. Edit about.php and fill it with some content (maybe an information about you?).
6. You can change the default icon (icon.png) with yours by overwriting the file. Transparent .png is recommended, 16x16px size.
