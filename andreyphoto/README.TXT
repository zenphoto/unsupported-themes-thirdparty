# 2. Theme description
	This theme has a few very neat aesthetic features:
		Index:
		 * First three album thumbnails are very large - a nice "Tada" effect
		 * Large random image thumbnail right below - something new every refresh
		 * Four next thumbnails are also quite big
		 * The rest of the albums are displayed in a neat list below
		 * Lovely sky background with a little cloud :)
		
		Album:
		 * Header fades to grey - focus is drawn towards the images instead
		 * Large thumbnails neatly organized
		 
		Image:
		 * Background goes to dark colors - the image is the focus
		 * Breadcrumb trail of where you are
		 
	The rest of the theme is pretty standard, wonderful ZenPhoto!
