# Unsupported third party Zenphoto themes

This is an archive of third party themes we store because they have been abandoned by their original developers. 

Readme files or script comments will describe their use and these plugins are also listed on our site's extensions section:
http://www.zenphoto.org/theme/

Please remember that these themes are provided for your use and education but are not actively supported and maintained by the ZenphotoCMS team. Many of these themes are quite old and may not work correctly with current ZenphotoCMS versions.

Although we don't actively support these, we welcome contributions via pull requests or even taking over development. Please read the contributor guidelines: http://www.zenphoto.org/news/general-contributor-guidelines#providing-themes-and-plugins

##License
Most of the contents is **GPL v2 or later** licensed, e.g. those created by current or former ZenphotoCMS team members. But since there are also third party solutions collected *please see each tool for its exact licensing*.
